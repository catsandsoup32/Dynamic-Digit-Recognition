# Dynamic-Digit-Recognition

## Dataset Credit
Most of the data was downloaded from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols), which was itself parsed, extracted and modified from a CROHME dataset. Many thanks to the authors!

The 'asterik' and 'forward_flash' folders were downloaded from this [Github repo](https://github.com/wblachowski/bhmsds?tab=readme-ov-file).
